# Multi-Class Classification Project

## Overview

This project, conducted over two weeks in an academic context for the Machine Learning "enseignement" at Université de Technologie de Compiègne, focuses on developing a multi-class classification model to predict smoking status based on physiological signals. 
\n The goal is to leverage machine learning techniques to accurately classify individuals into different categories based on their health data, which can aid in public health initiatives and personalized medicine.

## Key Features

- **Data Utilization**: The model utilizes datas collected from National Health Insurance Service in Korea, incorporating various physiological parameters. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset)
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: The project employs several machine learning algorithms to evaluate and compare their effectiveness in classification tasks (Logistic regression, SVC, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, KNN)
- **Model Evaluation**: Weighted F1-score performance metric is used to assess the model's performance (unbalanced multi-class prediciton).
